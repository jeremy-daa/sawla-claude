        "body": "For most private Ethiopia journeys, October to February is the strongest all-round window. Roads are generally more reliable, the northern highlands are clear, wildlife viewing is easier in Simien and Bale, and the light is excellent for photography. November is especially balanced: green after the rains, not yet as busy as Christmas and Timkat, and workable across the historic north, Omo Valley, Bale and the Rift Valley."

        "body": "Ethiopia’s religious calendar is one of the strongest reasons to travel. Meskel brings public bonfires and processions in late September. Timkat, Ethiopian Epiphany, fills Gondar, Lalibela and Addis Ababa with white-robed pilgrims and tabot processions. Fasika, Ethiopian Orthodox Easter, is quieter but deeply atmospheric, especially in Lalibela. Festival trips require early hotel booking, slower pacing and respectful crowd management."

        "body": "June to September is often dismissed too quickly. The main rains can make remote roads difficult, especially in parts of the Omo, highland dirt tracks and some wildlife areas. But the same months bring dramatic green landscapes, powerful skies, fewer visitors and beautiful photography. A rainy-season Ethiopia itinerary should use more flights, choose lodges carefully and avoid overpromising remote access."

November to February is usually the most comfortable period; March may still be possible for heat-tolerant travelers, while the hotter months can be extremely demanding. Even in the cooler season, Danakil requires early starts, proper water planning, experienced Afar logistics and realistic expectations about volcanic and road conditions."

        "q": "Can I travel to Ethiopia in July or August?",

        "q": "When should I book a Timkat trip?",
