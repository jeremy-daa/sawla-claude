              These Terms &amp; Conditions govern the relationship between Sawla Tours (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;, &ldquo;the company&rdquo;) — a private tour operator based in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — and the person or persons making a booking (&ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;the client&rdquo;). Submitting an enquiry does not constitute a booking. A booking is only confirmed as set out in Section 2 below.

              A booking becomes confirmed when:

              All prices are quoted in US Dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated. Prices are based on the cost of services at the time of quotation. Once a deposit is received and a booking is confirmed, the price is fixed for the confirmed itinerary.

              Ethiopia is a complex travel destination.
