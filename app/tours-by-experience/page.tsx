  {
    question: 'Are all Sawla Tours trips private?',
    answer:
      'Most Sawla journeys are private, tailor-made tours for couples, families, friends, photographers, organizations or small groups. Any selected fixed-date departure is clearly identified as such.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How many days do I need for Ethiopia?',
    answer:
      'Eight to fourteen days is a useful range for a first journey. A focused Addis and Lalibela trip can work in four or five days, while combining the historic north, Omo Valley, wildlife or Danakil usually requires two weeks or more for sensible pacing.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the best time to visit Ethiopia?',
    answer:
      'October to March is the broadest dry-season window for many routes, but it is not universally best. Festival travel, green landscapes, bird breeding, coffee harvests and regional rainfall patterns may favor other months. Dates should be matched to the exact journey style.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I combine different tour styles?',
    answer:
      'Yes. Many of the strongest Ethiopia itineraries combine two or three interests—for example historic sites with Simien wildlife, Omo culture with photography, Bale birding with coffee country, or Timkat with the northern heritage route.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are the itineraries fixed?',
    answer:
      'No. Published itineraries are examples. Sawla adjusts route, duration, accommodation, activity level, guide profile and transport to your dates, interests and comfort expectations.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is Ethiopia suitable for luxury travel?',
    answer:
      'Ethiopia can be designed with excellent hotels and the best available lodges in key destinations, but standards vary by region. Remote areas may require simple lodges, community stays or mobile camps. Sawla explains the accommodation reality before booking.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How does Sawla handle safety and changing access?',
    answer:
      'The team reconfirms routes, local conditions, site access and supplier operations before departure and during the journey. When a region is not suitable, Sawla proposes a viable alternative rather than relying on outdated itinerary assumptions.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can Sawla arrange photography, drone or binocular permissions?',
    answer:
      'Sawla can advise on and coordinate applicable permission processes. Drone operation is regulated and requires advance approval, which is not guaranteed. Binocular or specialist-equipment requirements can also change, so equipment details should be shared early.',

              Sawla Tours creates private, tailor-made journeys across Ethiopia, including historic and cultural tours, Omo Valley community journeys, wildlife safaris, birdwatching expeditions, trekking and Danakil adventures, religious festival tours, photography trips, coffee and special-interest travel, Addis Ababa day tours and professional filming support.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ethiopia resists the ordinary travel formula. Its greatest places are not gathered along one road, and its strongest experiences are not interchangeable. A historian, birder, photographer, family and expedition traveler need different routes, guides, pacing and logistics.

            <p className="font-medium text-charcoal">
              That is why Sawla begins with how you want to travel—not with a fixed package.
